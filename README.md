# Assault-Cube-Simple-Trainer
First open source project of mine that is showcasing my development path for C++.

## Specifications
- Needs to be run as a 32 bit program as Assault Cube runs 86x on both Windows and Mac
- Base files are required, as of now, the "base files" are the following 
[
mem.cpp / mem.h
proc.cpp / proc.h
Assault Cube Trainer.cpp
]
- These "base" files will change throughout my expierence with using C++ for writing to memory addresses,
multi level pointers, and more. 

## Disclaimers 
- The cheat may break, it's not 100% and Im not making it to "make profit", this "cheat" is open sourced
for begineers like me to find some open source code for games they can use and try to decyipher to understand. 

- I am not the best with C++, if you find bugs or errors, you can send me a message on discord at ssh#8423, if that 
discord doesn't work, then please find a way to contact me through GitHub! 

- The application doesn't allow for double checks in regards of looking for an application window constantly, if you 
run the program, it will hook, however, if you close the game it will stay in a "hooked" condition, and allow you to 
use it freely, it just won't do anything.
